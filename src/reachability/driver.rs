//! Relay acquisition driver.
//!
//! Owns every state transition for this node's MASQUE relay: the initial
//! acquisition at startup, the backoff retry when no candidate accepts,
//! the republish-then-reacquire sequence when an existing relay is lost,
//! and the K-closest-eviction watcher that forces a rebind when the
//! chosen relayer drops out of the close group.
//!
//! ## State machine
//!
//! The driver runs as a single tokio task and cycles through three states:
//!
//! 1. **Acquiring**: call [`run_relay_acquisition`]. On success, publish
//!    the full typed self-record (direct addresses + relay-allocated
//!    address tagged [`AddressType::Relay`]) to K-closest peers, store
//!    the relayer peer ID, and enter the **Holding** state. Relay
//!    serving stays permanently enabled. On failure, publish the
//!    direct-only address set so the node remains as reachable as
//!    possible, arm the exponential backoff timer, and enter the
//!    **Backoff** state.
//! 2. **Holding**: subscribe to `KClosestPeersChanged` events and poll
//!    [`TransportHandle::is_relay_healthy`] every
//!    [`HEALTH_POLL_INTERVAL`]. On relayer-evicted, unhealthy-tunnel,
//!    or shutdown, transition to **Lost**.
//! 3. **Lost**: run the `republish-direct-only → reacquire` sequence.
//!    The republish MUST happen **before** the acquisition walk starts,
//!    so the network stops dialing the dead relay address during the
//!    1–10 s acquisition window. After republishing, loop back to
//!    **Acquiring**.
//! 4. **Backoff**: wait for the current backoff window or a
//!    `KClosestPeersChanged` event (whichever comes first), then loop
//!    back to **Acquiring**. Successful acquisition resets the backoff.
//!
//! Clients ([`NodeMode::Client`](crate::network::NodeMode::Client)) do
//! not spawn the driver at all — they are outbound-only and do not need
//! a relay.
