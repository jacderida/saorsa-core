/// under a read lock on the routing table instead of an exclusive write
/// lock. The previous write-lock design serialised all readers behind
/// every touch, which at 1000 nodes became the dominant contention point.
///
/// Why a mutex instead of an atomic: `Instant` is opaque (no stable `u64`
/// representation) and can legitimately represent times in the past
/// (tests backdate `last_seen` to mark peers stale). Any epoch-based
/// `AtomicU64` encoding would have to either (a) panic/saturate on past

/// risks `Instant` underflow on recently booted systems. A
