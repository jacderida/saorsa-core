## Executive Summary

Saorsa Core implements a defense-in-depth security architecture designed for decentralized networks operating in adversarial environments. The system provides:

- **Post-quantum cryptography** with ML-DSA-65 signatures and ML-KEM-768 key exchange
- **Multi-layer node monitoring** with automatic eviction of misbehaving nodes
- **EigenTrust++ reputation** for trust-weighted routing and storage decisions
- **Geographic diversity enforcement** to prevent centralization and collusion
- **Byzantine fault tolerance** with configurable f-out-of-3f+1 security model
- **Data integrity verification** using BLAKE3 content hashes

---

## Cryptographic Foundation

### Post-Quantum Algorithms

All cryptographic operations use NIST-standardized post-quantum algorithms:

| Function | Algorithm | Security Level |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Digital Signatures | ML-DSA-65 (FIPS 204) | NIST Level 3 (~128-bit quantum) |
| Key Encapsulation | ML-KEM-768 (FIPS 203) | NIST Level 3 (~128-bit quantum) |
| Symmetric Encryption | Upper-layer responsibility | N/A |
| Hashing | BLAKE3 | 256-bit |

### Identity Binding

Node identities are cryptographically bound to their network addresses:

```
NodeId = BLAKE3(serialize(ML-DSA-65 public key))
```

This binding is verified during:
- Node join operations
- Message authentication
- Routing validation and trust-based admission
- Data storage challenges

---

## Node Monitoring & Eviction

### Liveness Tracking

The routing maintenance system continuously monitors node health through the `NodeLivenessState` tracker:

```rust
pub struct NodeLivenessState {
    pub consecutive_failures: u32,      // Tracked per-node
    pub last_success: Option<Instant>,  // For staleness detection
    pub total_failures: u32,            // Historical record
    pub total_successes: u32,           // For response rate calculation
}
```

**Monitoring Triggers:**
- Every DHT operation (GET, PUT, FIND_NODE)
- Periodic health pings (configurable interval)
- Validation responses

### Routing-Table Trust Criteria

Trust affects routing-table membership in two stages:

| Reason | Default Threshold | Configuration |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Lazy swap eligibility | < 0.35 | `swap_threshold` |
| Close-group quarantine / lookup avoidance | < 0.20 | `quarantine_threshold` |
| New peer admission | >= 0.20 | `quarantine_threshold` |
| Explicit quarantine readmission | >= 0.45 | `quarantine_readmit_threshold` |
| Staleness | Configurable | `stale_timeout` |

Peers outside the K-closest set are not globally evicted solely for low trust.
They are omitted from local lookup results, FIND_NODE responses, and automatic
lookup paths below the quarantine threshold, and can be lazily replaced when
better candidates need the slot.
Peers already in the routing table at or above the quarantine threshold but
below the readmission threshold may remain in the table, including after moving
into the K-closest set. New routing-table admissions require the quarantine
threshold. Peers carrying an explicit quarantine marker require the higher
readmission threshold; if the bounded exact-marker set has overflowed, unmarked
admissions also fail closed against that higher threshold.

### Quarantine Reasons

Routing-table quarantine decisions are represented by events such as:

```rust
pub enum QuarantineReason {
    LowTrustCloseGroup,          // Close-group trust below threshold
    Stale,                       // No activity timeout during revalidation
    IdentityMismatch,            // Address authenticated as another peer
}
```

**Recovery Mechanism:** Quarantined peers recover by trust decay toward neutral.
They are not manually probed; they must be rediscovered through the normal
admission path after reaching the readmission threshold.

## EigenTrust++ Reputation System

### Trust Score Calculation

The EigenTrust++ implementation computes global trust scores through iterative power iteration:

```
Trust Score = α * (local trust) + (1-α) * (global trust)
```

**Parameters:**
- Alpha (teleportation factor): 0.4
- Decay rate: 0.99 per epoch
- Convergence threshold: 1e-6
- Maximum iterations: 100

### Multi-Factor Trust Assessment

Trust scores incorporate multiple behavioral dimensions:

| Factor | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Response Rate | 0.40 | Fraction of queries answered successfully |
| Uptime | 0.20 | Continuous availability measurement |
| Storage Performance | 0.15 | Data availability and retrieval speed |
| Bandwidth | 0.15 | Network contribution capacity |
| Compute | 0.10 | Processing capability for attestations |

### Trust Integration Points

Trust scores influence:
1. **Routing Decisions**: Higher-trust nodes preferred for query forwarding
2. **Storage Placement**: Data replicated to trusted nodes first
3. **Witness Selection**: Only nodes above minimum trust can witness
4. **Eviction Priority**: Low-trust nodes evicted first during capacity constraints

---

## Data Storage Verification

Note: Application data storage and retrieval are handled in **saorsa-node**. saorsa-core
tracks availability outcomes via trust signals to downscore nodes that fail to serve
expected data.

### Nonce-Based Attestation Challenges

Data integrity is verified through cryptographic attestation using the formula:

```
Response = BLAKE3(nonce || data)
```

**Security Properties:**
- **Nonce freshness**: Random 32-byte nonces prevent precomputation
- **Binding**: Response cryptographically bound to actual data
- **Efficiency**: BLAKE3 enables fast verification at scale

### Challenge Protocol

```
1. Challenger generates random nonce
2. Challenger sends challenge(nonce, data_key) to holder
3. Holder computes BLAKE3(nonce || stored_data)
4. Holder returns signed response
5. Challenger verifies response matches expected hash
```

### Attestation Failure Handling

| Failure Count | Action |
|---------------|--------|
| 1 | Warning logged, node flagged |
| 2+ | Node marked for eviction |
| Repeated | Permanent blacklist consideration |

---

## Anti-Sybil & Geographic Protections

### IP Diversity Enforcement

The `IPDiversityEnforcer` prevents network concentration through subnet-level limits:

| Subnet Level | Default Limit | Purpose |
|--------------|---------------|---------|
| /64 (Host) | 1 node | Single allocation |
| /48 (Site) | 3 nodes | Organization limit |
| /32 (ISP) | 10 nodes | Provider diversity |
| ASN | 20 nodes | Network diversity |

**Stricter Limits for Known Providers:**
- Hosting providers: Limits halved
- VPN providers: Limits halved
- Known bad actors: Blocked entirely

### Geographic Diversity

The witness selection system enforces geographic distribution:

```rust
pub struct WitnessSelectionCriteria {
    pub min_regions: usize,           // Minimum 3 distinct regions
    pub max_per_region: usize,        // Maximum 2 per region
    pub exclude_same_asn: bool,       // Avoid same network provider
    pub prefer_low_latency: bool,     // Performance optimization
}
```

**Anti-Centralization Protections:**
- Minimum 3 geographic regions for witness quorum
- Cross-jurisdiction distribution for legal resilience
- ASN diversity to prevent infrastructure-level attacks

### Eclipse Attack Detection

The routing table monitors for eclipse attack patterns:

```rust
pub struct EclipseDetector {
    pub min_diversity_score: f64,        // Minimum 0.5
    pub max_subnet_concentration: f64,   // Maximum 20%
    pub routing_table_analysis: bool,    // Continuous monitoring
}
```

**Detection Triggers:**
- Routing table diversity score < 0.5
- Single subnet exceeds 20% of known nodes
- Rapid churn from single source

---

## Byzantine Fault Tolerance

### BFT Configuration

The system implements a configurable f-out-of-3f+1 Byzantine fault tolerance model:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| f (fault tolerance) | 2 | Maximum Byzantine nodes tolerated |
| Required Confirmations | 5 (2f+1) | Minimum for consensus |
| Witness Count | 7 (3f+1) | Total witnesses selected |

### Close Group Consensus

DHT operations requiring consensus use close group validation:

```
1. Select 3f+1 closest nodes to key
2. Broadcast operation to all members
3. Collect signed responses
4. Require 2f+1 matching responses
5. Reject if threshold not met
```
