**Identifying potential security bug usage**

I found that NodeDescriptor’s public key is accessed in adaptive/security, suggesting it’s used for verification. This raises a concern that if find_closest_nodes returns a local NodeDescriptor mistakenly, security checks could misidentify nodes and cause verification errors or vulnerabilities. I’ll inspect usage around adaptive/security.rs line 688 to confirm this.

The public key mismatch in NodeDescriptor existed before, but now using the local key instead of per-node random keys may cause identical public keys for all nodes, possibly breaking cryptographic checks or causing confusion; this might exacerbate issues though not newly introduced, so next I'll check related diffs in DHT network manager for clearer impact.

**Identifying potential error handling regression**

Noted that the new `get` method calls `router.route().await` but ignores its error, unlike the prior `retrieve` method which propagated it; this may weaken error detection but isn't necessarily a bug.

**Noticing missing metrics update on early local hits**

The `get` method returns early on local backend hits without updating success or hops metrics, introducing a minor but valid inconsistency that could mislead monitoring.

**Identifying major store-retrieve key mismatch bug**

Discovered that store uses a derived DHT key (blake3 or original key) to save data but returns a content hash (sha256 of key+value) used as retrieval key. Retrieval uses this content hash directly as DHT key, causing fetch failures since stored data lives under a different key. This is a critical mismatch likely causing retrieval to always fail.

**Analyzing potential misuses in DHT storage and identity handling**

I'm verifying that `AdaptiveDHT::store` may be unused and that removed code implies architecture changes avoiding general store/retrieve methods. I’m also considering that using the local identity’s public key for remote nodes in `find_closest_nodes` could break identity verification but might be intentional since `NodeDescriptor` may serve routing heuristics rather than strict security checks. Next, I'll check `adaptive/security.rs` tests to confirm this behavior.

Next, I'll review related files for more logic changes and check core engine diffs for clearer bugs.

New DHT code applies the local public key for all nodes, which differs from prior random keys but still mismatches remote nodes' identities; however, identity verification usually relies on NodeDescriptors from remote handshakes, so this mismatch may not cause failures except possibly in retrieval or replication contexts.

I've identified that `NodeDescriptor`'s local key misuse likely doesn't affect code, as routing mainly uses `NodeId`.

**Noting potential trust ID mismatch**

The trust provider uses NodeId derived from peer_id via blake3 hash, which may not always align with NodeIdentity's NodeId, risking zero trust entries unintentionally. This inconsistency could affect trust lookups but isn't definitively a bug.
thinking
**Identifying missing fallback in get method**

If candidate nodes are empty, AdaptiveDHT::get returns None instead of falling back to manager.get, causing retrieval failures when the routing table is unpopulated. This likely breaks retrieval at startup and differs from store's fallback behavior, marking a probable functional bug.

**Analyzing potential NodeId and peer_id mismatches**

The UserId hash doubles as NodeId bytes in AdaptiveDHT, which risks mixing user IDs with DHT node IDs; this might cause subtle bugs in coordinate derivation and peer ID handling. Additionally, candidate node peer IDs use hex string conversions that may not align with expected peer ID formats, especially in local backend contexts. Next, I'll inspect HyperbolicSpace for compatibility and verify DhtNetworkManager's local peer ID logic.
thinking
**Confirming public_key misuse causing identity collisions**

Switching NodeDescriptor's public_key from random keys to a shared local key makes all nodes appear identical, likely causing map collisions and identity verification failures. This is a new, more severe bug affecting node differentiation and trust computations, especially if NodeDescriptor is exposed externally. I'll review trust provider implications and the node ID derivation inconsistencies from peer_id strings next.

I found a pre-existing mismatch where `store` uses a DHT key derived from input key but returns a content hash based on key+value, while `retrieve` expects the content hash as the DHT key—this inconsistency can cause retrieval failures unless the key is the content hash itself. The recent code change to use raw keys if 32 bytes alters behavior but does not fix the fundamental mismatch, indicating the bug is longstanding rather than newly introduced.

There's a possible bug where `find_closest_nodes` uses the local public key for all nodes, causing node descriptors to have mismatched public keys and failing security validation; also, node_id creation in `DhtNetworkManager::new_with_node` may inconsistently handle peer_id bytes without hashing, so I'll verify node_id generation in related constructors next.

**Identifying potential security bug in node descriptor creation**

I found that in `find_closest_nodes`, the NodeDescriptor is created using the local identity's public key, which seems incorrect and could cause security issues or mismatches. Next, I'll review the surrounding code in `dht_integration.rs` to confirm this and look for a second bug.

**Highlighting public key misuse risk**

The local public key is incorrectly used for all NodeDescriptors, which breaks identity verification since NodeDescriptor's public_key must correspond to its node ID; this will cause `SecurityManager::validate_node_join` and similar checks to fail when those nodes are used for joining or security validation.
thinking
**Confirming public key mismatch is longstanding**

The identity verification failure from using local or random public keys in NodeDescriptors isn’t new but the trust mismatch caused by returning local keys is a provable issue worth highlighting. Also, I’m shifting to inspect routing strategy key formatting for potential impact.

**Identifying strategy naming mismatch**

The retrieval fails for "SOM" because the keys use "SOMRegion" while retrieval calls "SOM", causing a new bug after switching to debug format strings; this mismatch affects only SOM, not Kademlia or Hyperbolic, and may require aligning key naming or retrieval strings.

**Confirming partial bug persistence**

The mismatch between retrieval expecting "SOM" and keys using "SOMRegion" persists but likely isn't newly introduced since retrieval always failed with empty maps before; the patch fixes other strategies but leaves SOM retrieval broken due to naming inconsistency.

The patch introduces trust scoring failures for the local backend by hashing node IDs differently, causing trust lookups to always return zero and bypass weighting; it also adds an early return on local cache hits that skips updating successful lookup metrics, leading to undercounted metrics and potential skew in adaptation.

The changes introduce functional issues in AdaptiveDHT: trust scores are effectively bypassed for local backends due to NodeId mis-mapping, and lookup metrics are skipped on local cache hits. These are likely to affect routing decisions and monitoring accuracy.

Full review comments:

- [P2] Preserve node IDs for trust scoring — /Users/davidirvine/Desktop/Devel/projects/saorsa-core/src/adaptive/dht_integration.rs:606-608
  For the local backend, `peer_id` is derived from `node.id.to_string()`, but `score_candidates` later hashes this string in `peer_id_to_node_id`, producing a different `NodeId` than the DHT node ID derived from the user’s public key. That means `trust_provider.get_trust` will miss cached scores and treat every candidate as untrusted, effectively disabling trust-weighted selection whenever `AdaptiveDHT::new` (the default coordinator path) is used. Consider carrying the actual node ID bytes (or storing a `NodeId` directly on `CandidateNode`) for local candidates instead of re-hashing the string form.

- [P3] Update lookup metrics on local cache hits — /Users/davidirvine/Desktop/Devel/projects/saorsa-core/src/adaptive/dht_integration.rs:723-724
  When a network-backed lookup hits `manager.get_local`, the function returns immediately without incrementing `lookups_successful` or updating `average_lookup_hops`, so local cache hits never show up in `DHTMetrics`. If those metrics are used for monitoring or adaptive routing decisions, they will be skewed whenever a key is already cached. Update the metrics before returning or move the accounting to cover the early return path.
